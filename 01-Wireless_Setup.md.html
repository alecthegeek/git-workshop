<h1>Git Workshop Instructions</h1>

<h2>WiFi for Demos</h2>

<p>We may try to use a private network today (without port blocking or restrictions) to share code amongst ourselves. I've brought along a small WiFi device that can handle 30-50 people, but won't give us Internet access. That's alright though as we aren't going to use the 'net much.</p>

<p>Please ensure you can sign on to the following wireless network:</p>

<p>Wireless SSID:
    AI-MOBILE
Password:
    students</p>

<p>Additionally, try to connect to my laptop (ping it), as I'll host some repos there.  My notebook IP address is:
    10.0.1.2</p>

<h2>Handouts</h2>

<p>These instructions are downloadable at GitHub from, of all things, a Git repo:
<a href="http://github.com/matthewmccullough/git-workshop">http://github.com/matthewmccullough/git-workshop</a></p>

<p>You don't need Git to download them though. GitHub has a download link at the top of each page that lets you get the files in ZIP format without a client Git tool.</p>

<h2>Bookmarks</h2>

<p>Matthew maintains a list of interesting (hand-picked) resources about Git tools, features, releases, and uses.  These bookmarks are updated weekly and can be <a href="http://delicious.com/matthew.mc">found on Delicious</a>.</p>
